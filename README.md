Analyzing Comparative Outcomes for Mexican Migrant Workers in the United States
by Meghan Zavala

Below is a link to my research paper from the Migration & Development course as a part of my Master of Public Policy studies at UC San Diego. The files above include my Stata code used to analyze the data and create graphs. All data used comes from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP 174) migration and life files and utilizes methodology used by Shelby O'Neill in their 2022 article “The Tradeoff of Temporariness: Economic and Social Impacts of H-2A Status on Mexican Migrant Men.”
